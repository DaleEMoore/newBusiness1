Improve this so that I get contact phone numbers from the Internet.
    Do the "TODO; lookup phone numbers for this entity" manually researching the best approach to automation.

DaleHome.QnD can't run this because Tkinter won't install.
    Tkinter is python2
    tkinter is python3
    python3's tkinter seems to work OK, convert to python3.
    But what if the zipfile library only works with python2?
    And what about dateutil?

    tkinter fails on ""
    ZipFile failing on "TypeError: pwd: expected bytes, got <class 'str'>"

    I'm not sure how, but it's running now.
    I went back to python2. Tkinter works now.
    My previous bug where there is no "property address" failed and I downloaded the latest code with the fix.
    It's working now with python2.
